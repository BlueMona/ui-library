# Getting Started

Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design
reusableâ€”reusability makes scale possible. This is the heart and primary value
of design systems. A design system is a collection of reusable components,
guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of
applications.

## Consistency

Your first, most important task when starting out is to define the rules of your
system, document them, and ensure that everyone follows them. When you have
clearly documented code standards and best practices in place, designers and
developers from across your organization can easily use and, more importantly,
contribute to your design system.
