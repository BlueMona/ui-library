/**
 * This module makes reload attempts on every currently rendered <img> elements in case image loading has failed.
 * 1. It subscribes to socket reconnect event, in most cases it means we had a network disconnection
 *    and there might be some images that failed to load because of that.
 *    Note that in a few cases socket reconnect could happen on a live network, but it's not an issue since
 *    event handler is not heavy.
 * 2. It finds all image elements, check if they've completed loading and if it was successful
 * 3. It forces reload of failed images.
